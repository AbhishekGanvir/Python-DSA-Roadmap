# Python DSA Roadmap (2025 Beginner → Interview Ready)



**Phase 1: Fundamentals (Week 1–2)**
- Loops, conditionals, functions
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Input/output, string manipulation
*Practice:* Reverse string, find max/min, frequency count

**Phase 2: Core Data Structures (Week 3–6)**
| Topic | What to Learn | Practice Ideas |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Arrays / Lists | indexing, slicing, traversal | sum, rotate, search element |
| Stacks | LIFO, push/pop | valid parentheses, undo feature |
| Queues | FIFO | circular queue, ticket system |
| Linked Lists | node, traversal, insert/delete | reverse, detect loop |
| Hashing (Dicts/Sets) | key-value, hash collisions | find duplicates, 2-sum problem |
*Interview Tip:* Be ready to explain time complexity (O(n))

**Phase 3: Advanced Structures (Week 7–10)**
| Topic | Learn | Practice |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Recursion | base case, recursive calls | factorial, Fibonacci, subsets |
| Trees | binary tree, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder) | height, leaf count |
| Binary Search Trees (BST) | insert, search | validate BST, find min/max |
| Heaps / Priority Queues | heapq module | top-k elements |
| Graphs | adjacency list, DFS, BFS | shortest path, connected components |

**Phase 4: Algorithms (Week 11–14)**
| Algorithm | Learn | Practice |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Sorting | bubble, insertion, merge, quicksort | sort colors, merge intervals |
| Searching | linear, binary | element search, sqrt(x) |
| Greedy | local optimum → global optimum | coin change, activity selection |
| Dynamic Programming (DP) | overlapping subproblems | Fibonacci, knapsack, LIS |

**Phase 5: Problem Solving Practice (Week 15–18)**
- Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeStudio
- Solve 2–3 easy → medium questions daily
- Focus on patterns (sliding window, recursion, 2 pointers)
- Note concept + time complexity after each problem

**Phase 6: Project + Resume Integration**
- Use DSA to optimize a Python project (e.g., chat app search using hash map)
- Resume line:
  > “Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (focusing on problem-solving & optimization).”

**Tools:** VS Code / PyCharm, Jupyter / Google Colab, GitHub repository

**Interview Tips:**
- Explain why you choose a data structure
- Mention time complexity
- Focus on logic over Python syntax perfection
